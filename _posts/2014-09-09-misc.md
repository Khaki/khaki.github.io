### From Programming Ruby
> ###Inheritance and Mixins
Some object-­oriented languages (such as C++) support multiple inheritance, where a class can have more than one immediate parent, inheriting functionality from each. Although powerful, this technique can be dangerous, because the inheritance hierarchy can become ambiguous.
Other languages, such as Java and C#, support single inheritance. Here, a class can have only one immediate parent. Although cleaner (and easier to implement), single inheritance also has drawbacks —in the real world, objects often inherit attributes from multiple sources (a ball is both a bouncing thing and a spherical thing, for example). Ruby offers an interesting and powerful compromise, giving you the simplicity of single inheritance and the power of multiple inheritance. A Ruby class has only one direct parent, so Ruby is a single-­inheritance language. However, Ruby classes can include the functionality of any number of mixins (a mixin is like a partial class definition). This provides a controlled multiple inheritance-like capability with none of the drawbacks.

实际上Java和C#虽然是单继承的语言，但其提供了接口支持。Ruby的Maxins与接口异曲同工，只是Maxins不需要再特地实现接口的方法。

接口是Java和C#进行类型转换的关键（比父类更具有通用性），实现了同一接口的类可以视为同一［类型］，在工厂模式中比较常用。应该相当于Ruby的鸭子模型（还未学习到，到时候再分析）。
